  <h1>Guide to Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn</h1>
<div class="divider">
  <p>Windsor Terrace is a small-ish neighborhood in Brooklyn, above it is Park Slope and below it is Kennsington. To it's right is prospect park, and Greenwood Cemetary is on it's left. It's known for tree-lined streets, historic architecture, and strong sense of community.</p>

 <h2 id="nitehawk-cinema-title" >Nitehawk Cinema</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Nitehawk Cinema is a really nnice, kind of expensive, movie theater. It serves food as you watch movies, which is where it can get kind of pricy. They show popular movies and indie movies, and sometimes older movies too which normally aren't back in theaters. </p>
